### 2026-10-16 — batch 1 (tier 0)
Processed 24 tier-0 articles (19 done, 5 skipped as reviews/classification reports), 15 records.
New actors: STIMATE/TMEM110, TMEM203, SELENOK, UNC93B1.
Convention: STING partners with no calcium link (STAT2, COPA, STEEP, VAPB, TRIM13, SEL1L, ARF1...)
are NOT recorded — the build's inclusion rule would drop them anyway.
13 tier-0 articles were read but not recorded; they remain `pending` and are first in the queue.

### 2026-10-16 — tier 0 complete (primary research)
All tier-0 primary-research articles are processed: 49 done, 22 skipped.
The 121 tier-0 articles still pending are reviews/commentaries.
Records this session: 21 in data/raw/lit_20261016_b01.jsonl.

Notable: TRPV2 enters the map (STING binds and represses the ER Ca2+ channel; cGAMP
releases it) — the mirror image of STIM1 restraining STING. STIM1 is also *required*
for STING exocytosis during HSV-1 infection (PMC11005388), which conflicts with the
pure ER-brake model and should surface as a conflict badge.

Roughly half of the tier-0 articles yielded nothing: they cite Srikanth 2019 rather
than producing their own STIM1/STING data. Each decision carries a `--note` in the queue.

Lead not in the corpus: Woo et al., Cell 2024 (STING links glutamate excitotoxicity to
ferroptosis via STIM1), known only through its preview PMID 39059368. PubTator search
does not surface it; add it by PMID once identified.

### 2026-10-19 — tier 1, batch of 50 (the low-yield tail)
Processed the next 50 tier-1 articles (22 done, 28 skipped, each with a queue note), 5 records in
`data/raw/lit_20261019_b02.jsonl`. New nodes: BCL6, NFATC1.

**Next session:** keep going inside tier 1 (`queue next 50 --tier 1`), resuming at PMID 37961129.
The generated header line above names PMID 36769349 because it is the first pending article
overall, but tier 0 holds nothing but reviews now.

Yield: STING GOF T cells (PMC12423328) give the cleanest result of the batch — basal Ca2+ is
higher in STING V154M T cells and 4 h of DMXAA reproduces it in wild-type cells, with NFATc1
upregulated: STING drives the Ca2+-NFAT arm, the mirror of STIM1 restraining STING. BCL6 enters
the map as a transcriptional input to the anchor: Bcl6+/- Tfh cells downregulate Stim1 and show a
measurably weaker calcium response during B cell contact in vivo (FRET, 29% -> 8%).

Admitting NFATC1 also pulled six database-only edges into the graph (PRKACA, IKBKE, EGFR), with no
publications and no calcium content of their own. That is the build doing what it is told — every
kept node gets its database evidence — but it is worth watching: each new effector node widens the
graph more than the literature edge that justified it.

NEGATIVE worth keeping: in STING N153S Purkinje cells (PMC12746686) the CRAC inhibitor GSK-7975A
does not restore firing — the STIM1/CRAC arm is not the effector of that degeneration.

Lead not recorded: RCN1 (reticulocalbin-1, PMC10701779), an ER calcium-binding protein whose
knockdown switches on STING in AML cells — a second ER brake on STING next to STIM1, except that
the inclusion rule drops it (no GO calcium annotation, no calcium term in the claim sentence).
Revisit if a paper ties RCN1 to ER calcium and STING in one claim.

The tail is now mostly bioinformatics screens, atlases and network-pharmacology papers that
co-mention the genes without measuring anything. Seven articles were read in full; of the other
43, none had a single sentence carrying an anchor and a calcium term together, and only two
mentioned STIM1/ORAI1 at all (a patient count and an author-contribution artefact). That
co-occurrence screen is what made a 50-article batch feasible and is now step 3 of the protocol.
